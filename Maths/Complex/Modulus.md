# Modulus

The modulus of a [[Complex Numbers]] is defined as the absolute distance between a complex number and the origin, this is accomplished through the Pythagorean Theorem. It can be stated that $|z|^{2} = a^{2} + b^{2}$ for a [[Complex Numbers|complex number]] $z = a+bi$.

# Uses

The modulus function is most commonly used in the representation of complex numbers in [[Polar Form|polar form]].
