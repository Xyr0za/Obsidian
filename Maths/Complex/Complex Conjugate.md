# The Conjugate

The complex conjugate can be described as the reflection of a complex number over the real axis, or $z* = a - bi$, where $z=a+bi$

The conjugate was discovered as a result of the Quadratic Formula, where as a result of the $\pm \Delta$, present in the formula; the need for the complex conjugate was realised.  With both the complex number, and its conjugate being solutions to a given quadratic.

# Interesting properties

When a given [[Complex Numbers|Complex Number]] is multiplied by its complex conjugate, the resulting [Real Number](), as it will always be real, is equal to the [[Modulus]] of said complex number, squared; or $z \cdot z* = a^{2}+ b^{2}  = |z|^2$.

This can also be observed when put into [[Polar Form]]

$$z = |z|e^{i\arg{z}}, z* = |z|e^{-i\arg{z}}, \implies z \cdot z* = |z|^2$$
