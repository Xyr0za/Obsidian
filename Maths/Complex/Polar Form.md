# Polar Form 

Polar form is a way of representing [[Complex Numbers]] on the complex plane; this method utilises **[[Euler's Formula]]** in order to represent said numbers; with any given complex number consisting of two arguments: the numbers magnitude, and its phase. 

The phase of a complex number is known as its angle from the positive horizontal real axis, or known as, $\arctan{(\frac{a}{b}})$. The magnitude of a polar form number is the coefficient of $we^{\theta i }$, or the points distance from the origin. See [[Modulus|modulus]].
