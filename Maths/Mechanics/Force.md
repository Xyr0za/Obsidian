# What is force? 

Force is a [[Vector Quantity]] that transfers workable energy to enact a change in velocity upon an object, unless counter balanced.

This is seen more clearly through [[Newtons Laws|Newtons Second Law]] where it is stated that *"Force is directly proportional to mass X acceleration"*. 
$$f=ma$$
# Types of Force

There area many varieties of force that exist, such as [[Contact Forces|Contact]] and [[Non-Contact Forces]]. Some prominent examples of force include [[Tension]], [[Weight]], [[Centripetal Force]] and [[Thrust]].
