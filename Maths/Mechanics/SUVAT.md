# What are the  SUVAT equations?

The SUVAT equations, colloquially referred to as the equations of motion, are a set of equations using:

* [[Displacement]]
* [[Velocity|Initial Velocity]]
* [[Velocity]]
* [[Acceleration]]
* [[Time]]

The equations were derived from the fundamental principles of calculus, and can apply to many situations as a result. See [[Projectile Motion]].

# The equations

$$s = ut + \frac{1}{2}at^{2}$$
$$
v^{2} = u^{2}+ 2as
$$
$$
v = u + at
$$
$$
s = \frac{1}{2} \cdot t(v + u)
$$
