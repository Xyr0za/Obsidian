# Hypothesis

The *null hypothesis*, $H_0$ is a statistical statement representing your basic assumption of the situation.

*(A basic comment on what $P(X)$ is)*

The *alternative hypothesis*, $H_1$, is a statement that contradicts the null hypothesis. 
The critical region is the set of all values where
