# What is it?
Implicit differentiation is an application of the [[Chain Rule]], wherein it is possible 
to differentiate $y$ with respect to $x$.

# Origins
Implicit differentiation stems from the Chain Rule, where $\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{dy}{du}\frac{du}{dx}$. In this case, $u = y$ providing the fundamental systems for which this functions on.

# Example 

Let $x^{2} + y^{2} = 8$.
$$2x + 2y \cdot \frac{dy}{dx} = 0$$
$$
2y + \frac{dy}{dx} = -2x
$$
$$
\frac{dy}{dx} = -\frac{2x}{y} = -\frac{x}{y}
$$
