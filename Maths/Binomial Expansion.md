# What is the Binomial Expansion?

The binomial expansion is a way of representing binomials in the form $(a + b)^{n}$ in the form of an power series. It is useful in many fields of maths including [[Combinatrics]], [[Calculus]] (Mainly for the [[Power Rule]]) and statistics in the form of the [[Binomial Distribution]].

It looks as follows:

$$
(x+y)^{z} = \sum\limits^{z}_{n=0} \binom{z}{n} \, x^{n} \, y^{z-n}
$$
