# What is Momentum?

Isaac Newton realised that if you apply a force to an object, you would change its velocity. He then concluded that mass would be a factor, and that momentum = mass Ã— velocity.

$$
\rho = m\,v
$$

The *si* units of momentum are, $kg \, m \, s^{-1}$. Momentum is a *vector* quantity and can be negative as  a result, this dictates the direction that it travels. 

[[Newtons Laws|Newtons First Law|]] states that: An object remains at rest or at a constant velocity unless acted on by an external resultant force. His second law states that: 
$$
F = ma = m \frac{\Delta V}{\Delta t} = \frac{\Delta (mv)}{t}
$$

The rate of change on momentum of an object is proportional to the resultant force on it. 
$Ns = kg \, m \, s^{-1}$. 

Change in momentum is equivalent to [[Impulse]].
