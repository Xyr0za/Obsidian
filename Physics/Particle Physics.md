# What is Particle Physics?

All physical matter in the universe is affected by 4 [[Fundamental Forces]] that dictate all particle interactions in the universe. These fundamental forces consist of: 

- Nuclear Weak
- Nuclear Strong
- Electromagnetic
- Gravity

Each force has its own range, and different properties; as well as having a respective exchange particle, that transfers the force between constituent elements of the reaction.

These particles are as follows: 

- Force, Weak, $W, Z$ boson
 - Electromagnetic $\gamma$, virtual photon
 - Gravity, $g$ graviton

# Radiation 

Particle physics also dictates the interactions between particles inside radioactivity interactions, and standard radiation decay in most particles. See [[Radiation]]
