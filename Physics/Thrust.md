# What is thrust?

Thrust is a force that is characterised by its upwards movement, it is commonly found in rockets in transit, as the reaction force to the expulsion of gas from its engines. Another common example of thrust is "upthrust" which arises as a result of buoyancy.

\draw[line width = 0.6mm] (-2,0) -- (-2, -4) -- (2, -4) -- (2,0) -- cycle;
\draw[->, line width = 0.6mm] (0, -6) -- (0, -4);

\node[anchor = west] at (0, -5) {Thrust $f \, N$};
