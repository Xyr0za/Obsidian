# What are Progressive Waves?

## Properties of Oscillations

A progressive wave is defined as: *A wave that transfers energy from one point to another without transferring the medium itself.* 

## Properties of a Progressive Wave

- [[Displacement]] ($x$) of a wave is the distance from a point on a wave from its equilibrium position. Displacement is a vector quantity; it can be positive or negative. 
- [[Amplitude]] ($A$) is the maximum displacement of a particle in the wave from its equilibrium position.
- [[Wavelength]] ($\lambda$) is the distance between points on successive oscillations of the wave that are in phase:  Measured in *metres* ($m$).

- [[Period]] ($t$) or time period, is the time taken for one complete oscillation or cycle of the wave, measured in *seconds*.

- [[Frequency]] ($f$) is the number of complete oscillations per unit time. Measured in $Hz$ or $s^{-1}$. 
- [[Speed]] ($v$) is the distance travelled by the wave per unit time. Measured in $m \, s^{-1}$ or metres per second. 


## Equations

The wave equation $v = f \, \lambda$  links *speed, frequency and wavelength* of a wave. This is relevant for both [[Transverse and Longitudinal Waves]]. 

### Breakdown of the wave equation

The wave equation shows that for a wave of constant speed: 
- As the wavelength *increases*, the frequency *decreases*. 
- As the wavelength *decreases*, the frequency *increases*.

$v = f \, \lambda \implies \lambda = \frac{v}{f}$


**THIS IS KNOWN AS AN INVERSE PROPORTIONALITY AS IT MATCHES THE FORMAT $y=\frac{k}{x}$**


## Exam Tips

You may see the wave equation be written as $c = f \lambda$ where c is the wave speed. However this can be a problematic as $c$ is often used to denote the [[Speed of Light]], or [[Speed of Light|Speed of Causality]], ($3 \times 10^{8}$).
