# What are Stationary Waves?

Stationary waves are produced by the [[Superposition]] of two waves of the same [[Frequency]] and [[Amplitude]] travelling in *opposite directions*. This is usually achieved by a [[Progressive Waves|Progressive Wave]] and its [[Reflection]]. 


## Key info

This superposition produced a wave pattern where the peaks and troughs of the wave *DO NOT* oscillate.  Stationary waves store energy, unlike [[Progressive Waves]] which transfer energy. 

# Nodes and Anti-Nodes
An anti-node is a point of maximum oscillation along a stationary wave in superposition. Whereas the node is a point of no oscillation.

Points that have an *odd* number of nodes between them are considered *out of phase*. Whereas points that have an *even* number of nodes between them are considered in phase.
