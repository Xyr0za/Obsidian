# What is Velocity and Speed?
An object with constant velocity also has constant speed. This can be explained through the fact that velocity is a [[Vector Quantity]] which means it pertains both magnitude and direction. 

For instance "A*n object has a velocity of 20 metres per second*  **to the east.**"

Constant Velocity $\implies$ Constant Speed + Direction

Speed is a scalar and thus only has magnitude. *No direction*.

# Identifying a Changing Velocity

An objects velocity is therefore not constant if *Speed* is not constant or *Direction* is not constant. This can be seen clearly through the orbits of satellites or any circular motion. 

Constant + Constant $\implies$ Constant.

Both properties are fulfilled when an object is *at rest*. 

Both [[Speed]] and [[Velocity]] are aspects of the 5 types of motion:
- Doesn't move at all, at rest
- Constant Speed
- Constant Velocity
- Constant Acceleration
- Changing Acceleration

When velocity is changing, [[Acceleration]] is present.
