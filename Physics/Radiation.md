# What is Radiation ?

There are many types of radiation; $\beta ^{+}, \, \beta ^ {+}, \, \alpha, \, \gamma$. Beta, Alpha, Gamma respectively. Each one has it sown unique traits and properties that dictate the way in which they interact.

For instance:

# Beta Decay

[[Beta Decay]] comes in two forms; beta- decay, and beta+ decay. Each one creates a respective $\beta$ particle of its respective charge, with the $\beta$ being an [[Electron]]. Thus it can be concluded that beta - decay releases a standard electron. This is then counteracted by the anti-lepton $\bar v _{e}$.  This is because [[Lepton]] Number **MUST** be conserved. 

$$
K^{40}  _{19} \rightarrow Ca^{40} _{20} + \beta ^{-} + \bar v_{e}
$$
