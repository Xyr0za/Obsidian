# What does Uniform mean?

When something is defined as being uniform, it means it is unchanging; it is aways the same. 

We use the word uniform when referencing many things; uniform motion is where the [[Velocity]] of an object is constant.

Uniform [[Acceleration]] is where an objects acceleration is constant.
