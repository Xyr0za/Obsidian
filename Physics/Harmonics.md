# What is it? 

Harmonic frequencies are frequencies of a wave that when reflected, oscillate at the perfect frequency to cancel each other out. This cancellation forms Nodes and Anti node; with nodes being points with minimum oscillation. Harmonics are also a form of [[Stationary Wave]]. 

# How can this be found? 
*The frequency of the nth harmonic is equal to n over twice the length of the string, multiplied by the square root of tension of the string; over its mass per square unit.*

$$
f_n = \frac{n}{2L} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{T}{\mu}}
$$
